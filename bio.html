<h1>Biography of Stephen Bonish</h1>
	<p>I grew up in Wilmington, MA with my family of 5.  In my house was my two older brothers and my mother and father.  As you can tell by my photo, I am quite strong.  My entire life, I have done nothing but lift weights.  I first went to the gym when I was 3 years old and I haven't missed a day since.  Now, I compete at the World's Strongest Man competition every year.  I have won this competition the last 3 years, and I believe I a am in shape to win again this coming year.  I will update everyone after this year's competition, which is on November 16th.  And that pretty much brings you up to the present with my life.</p>
